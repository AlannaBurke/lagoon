# Known issues
On Linux based systems the start of the elasticsearch container may fail due to a low `vm.max_map_count` setting.
```
elasticsearch_1  | ERROR: [1] bootstrap checks failed
elasticsearch_1  | [1]: max virtual memory areas vm.max_map_count [65530] is too low, increase to at least [262144]
```
