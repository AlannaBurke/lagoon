# MariaDB

## Galera

For improved reliability, MariaDB can be used in a cluster for production sites. This example, when placed in `.lagoon.yml` will enable Galera on the `production` branch.

```text
environments:
  production:
    types:
      mariadb: mariadb-galera
```

also you will need to change your service definition in your `docker-compose.yml`

```text
  mariadb:
    image: amazeeio/mariadb-galera-drupal
    labels:
      lagoon.type: mariadb
    ports:
      - "3306" # exposes the port 3306 with a random local port, find it with `docker-compose port mariadb 3306`
    environment:
      << : *default-environment
```

It is recommended to configure the environment before the initial deploy of the production site, otherwise manual intervention may be needed from your lagoon administrator.

## Additional MariaDB Logging

During the course of development, it may be necessary to enable either query logging or slow query logging. To do so just set the environment variables `MARIADB_LOG_SLOW` or `MARIADB_LOG_QUERIES`. This can be done in `docker-compose.yaml`.
